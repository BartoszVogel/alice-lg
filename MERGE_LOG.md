                    Comment:
                        This adds to api/response.go: 
                            RoutesAccepted     int           `json:"routes_accepted"` 
                            RoutesPipeFiltered int           `json:"routes_pipe_filtered"` 
                        This adds to sources/birdwatcher/parsers.go
                            RoutesAccepted:     mustInt(routes["pipe_imported"], 
                            RoutesPipeFiltered: mustInt(routes["pipe_filtered"],
